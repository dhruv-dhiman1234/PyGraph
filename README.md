# PyGraph package 1.0.0
This is a python package that will look forward making graph which would be used for reserach phase and educational phase. 
This package is divided into five parts, which contains PyGraphB(B - Basic), PyGraphM(M - Maths), PyGraphP(P - Phyiscs)
PyGraphCS(CS - Computer Science), PyGraphC(C - Chemistry). 

->PyGraphB

PyGraphB is a part of the PyGraph package that focuses on building the basic structure of graphs.
It supports creating 2D and 3D plots and helps with simple, flexible graph construction for use in any module included in the PyGraph project.

Features:
Graph planning

Choosing graph types (2D, 3D)

Setting unit lengths

Adding angles (optional)

Adding colors (optional)

Adding labels (optional)

Adding grids (optional)

Choosing type of graph(Bar chart, pie chart)

Naming of the axes

Having error handling with the help of AI and ML

  Intelligent Error Handling:
    PyGraphB uses basic AI and ML techniques to learn the behavior of the programmer using the module.
    It adjusts error messages and outputs depending on the user's style:
    If the user needs specific, detailed feedback.
    Or if the user prefers quick and general output.
    This makes the module easy to use and helpful for programmers at any level.
    
PyGraphB is designed to make basic graph usage simple and accessible for all users.

->PyGraphP

PyGraphP is a module of the PyGraph package that focuses on creating physics-related graphs, including applications in astronomy and advanced physical sciences.
It builds upon the Basic module, offering users more powerful features for those familiar with physics concepts.

Features:
Astronomy graphs (e.g., orbital paths, star charts)

Thermodynamics graphs (e.g., temperature vs entropy)

Theoretical physics graphs (e.g., spacetime models)

Shuttle landing simulations and related property graphs (e.g., velocity, altitude vs time)

Kinematics graphs (e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration vs time)

Classical physics graphs (e.g., force vs mass)

Wave graphs (e.g., sound and light wave representation)

Energy graphs (e.g., potential and kinetic energy changes)

PyGraphP is designed to help students, engineers, and researchers visualize physical phenomena easily and effectively.

->PyGraphC
PyGraphC is a module of the PyGraph package that specializes in generating chemistry-related graphs and visualizations.
It extends the Basic module, helping users model chemical behaviors, reactions, and trends effectively.

Features:
Molecular Structure Graphs
Visualize simple molecules and bonds between atoms.

Reaction Rate Graphs
Graph concentration vs time to observe how reactions proceed.

pH Scale Graphs
Plot solutions on a pH scale to visualize acidity or basicity.

Energy Diagrams
Display activation energy and energy changes during chemical reactions (endothermic/exothermic).

Periodic Trends Visualization
Graph atomic radius, electronegativity, ionization energy, and other trends across the periodic table.

Stoichiometry Graphs
Plot the relationship between reactants and products for balanced chemical equations.

Equilibrium Graphs
Visualize shifts in equilibrium positions according to changes in concentration, pressure, or temperature (Le Chatelier's Principle).

PyGraphC is designed for chemistry students, educators, and researchers who want clear and dynamic graphical representations of chemical concepts.


->PyGraphCS
PyGraphCS is a module of the PyGraph package that focuses on computer science-related graphs, including algorithms, data structures, and computational performance.

Features:
Sorting Algorithm Visualizations
Animate how sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.) work step-by-step.

Graph Algorithms Visualizations
Show Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and others on a visual graph.

Tree Structures
Display binary trees, AVL trees, heaps, and more.

Network Graphs
Visualize nodes and connections (e.g., social networks, computer networks).

Big-O Performance Graphs
Plot time complexity (input size vs execution time) to analyze algorithm efficiency.

Hash Map and Hash Table Visualization
Show the mapping of keys to values and how collisions are handled.

Artificial Intelligence Pathfinding Graphs
Visualize algorithms like A* or Dijkstra in pathfinding tasks.

PyGraphCS empowers computer science students, educators, and engineers by making complex abstract concepts more intuitive and visual.
